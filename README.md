# Tea Tree Mycorrhizal Associations

This repository contains all code related to the manuscript "Plasticity in the dual mycorrhizal associations of tea tree, *Melaleuca alternifolia*"

## About
*Melaleuca alternifolia*, commonly known as tea tree, is a commercially important crop plant native to Australia. Tea tree is delineated by two ecotypes, coastal and upland. Our project investigates the mycorrhizal associations of tea tree in coastal and upland populations, utilising ITS2 metabarcoding and root colonisation measurements. We aimed to determine mycorrhizal type of tea tree using microscopy and characterise the mycorrhizal fungal communities associated with tea tree ecotypes using metabarcoding.

## Data Availability
The data from this study are available from the figshare repository (https://doi.org/10.26181/25241788) in nine files: an information file, sample metadata that includes root colonisation measurements, OTU sequences in fasta format, OTU-by-sample matrix and taxonomy table for all eukaryotes, as well as OTU-by-sample matrices and taxonomy tables for both arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi.
