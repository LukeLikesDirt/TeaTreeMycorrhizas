This repository contains all code related to the manuscript "Plasticity in the dual mycorrhizal associations of tea tree, *Melaleuca alternifolia*"

## About
*Melaleuca alternifolia*, commonly known as tea tree, is a commercially important crop plant native to Australia. Tea tree is delinated by two primary ecotypes, coastal and upland.

This research investigates the mycorrhizal associations of tea tree in coastal and upland populations across eastern Australia, utilising ITS2 metabarcoding and root colonisation measurements.
